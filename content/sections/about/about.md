I am a third-year student at Epitech Nantes, specializing in IT development. During my first two years in school, I developed strong programming, algorithmic and software design skills.

I am passionate about new technologies and innovations, and I love facing complex challenges that allow me to use my skills creatively. I am also very curious and constantly looking for new ideas to improve my programming skills.

As a computer development student, I have worked on many projects, from mobile applications to video games to websites. I have gained practical experience in creating IT solutions, from design to implementation and maintenance.

I also developed good communication and teamwork skills working on group projects. I have learned to collaborate effectively with other developers, designers and project managers to deliver projects effectively and efficiently.

I am very motivated to continue learning and developing my IT development skills, and I look forward to seeing what the future holds for me in this exciting and ever-changing field.
